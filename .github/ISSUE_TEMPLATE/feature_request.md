## Problem Statement

What problem does this feature solve?
If this is “nice to have” or cosmetic, say so explicitly.

---

## Proposed Behavior

Describe the feature in concrete, user-visible terms.
CLI syntax, flags, output, error cases.

No mockups? Fine. No ambiguity? Required.

---

## Non-Goals

Explicitly list what this feature will **not** do.
This prevents scope creep and contributor fantasy.

---

## Impact / Risk

- Backward compatibility concerns
- Performance implications
- UX or behavioral changes

If there is no risk, justify why.

---

## Technical Constraints

List anything that must not change.
Examples:
- Public APIs
- Storage format
- Existing command semantics

---

## Suggested Implementation (Optional)

High-level approach only.
No bikeshedding, no premature abstractions.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

Clear, testable outcomes.
Example:
- Command `kitcat foo --bar` behaves as described
- Existing commands remain unchanged
